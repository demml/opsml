# GenAI Evaluation

Through Opsml's `Scouter` integration, Opsml provides you with tools to run offline LLM evaluations and comparisons. This is is often useful for when you (1) want to compare and benchmark various prompts/agents, and (2) you want to evaluate different versions of prompts and GenAI services that you may already be using in production.
